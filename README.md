This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript when comparing objects deeply. The initial `compareObjects` function uses `JSON.stringify`, which is unreliable for deep object comparison due to its inability to handle functions, circular references, and certain special values like `NaN` and `Infinity`.  The solution provides a more robust approach for accurate deep comparison.
